 **About FSU and Florida**

Founded in 1851, FSU was designated as one of two "preeminent" state universities in 2013 by the state legislature. FSU is classified as a Research University with Highest Research Activity (R1) by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. In 2018, U.S. News & World Report ranked Florida State as the 26th best public university in the United States. 

 Florida is the 3rd-most populous state in the U.S. and the state has a strong economy, mainly relying on tourism, agriculture, and transportation. With the nickname “Sunshine State”, Florida is also world renowned for beaches and amusement parks. Tallahassee, the home of FSU, is the capital of Florida. 


**About PI** 

Yanshuo Sun joined FSU as an Assistant Professor of Industrial Engineering in August 2018. Dr. Sun has broad research interests in transportation optimization problems, especially in public transit, air transportation, ridesharing, and multi-modal freight systems. He has widely published in renowned transportation journals including Transportation Research Parts A, B, and C. He is the recipient of multiple national awards and he has two research projects funded by federal agencies as the principal investigator. He expects to work on smart cities, connected communities, innovative mobility solutions, transportation economics, and large-scale logistics operations.

Prior to joining FSU, he is a Research Scientist and the Assistant Director of Research Program of the National Transportation Center at the University of Maryland, College Park.
